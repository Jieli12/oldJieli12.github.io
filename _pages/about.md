Welcome! Currently, I work as a Neuroimaging Data Analyst KTP Associate employed by [University of Kent (School of Mathematics, Statistics and Actuarial Science)](https://www.kent.ac.uk/mathematics-statistics-actuarial-science) and [Innovision IP Limited](https://www.innovision-ip.co.uk) from October 2023. Prior to that, I used to be a Research Officer supervised by [Professor Piotr Fryzlewicz](https://stats.lse.ac.uk/fryzlewicz/) on the change-point detection in the [Department of Statistics](https://www.lse.ac.uk/statistics) at [London School of Economics and Political Sciences](https://www.lse.ac.uk).

I completed my Ph.D. study in Statistics at [University of Kent](https://www.kent.ac.uk/mathematics-statistics-actuarial-science) in September 2021. My Ph.D. supervisor is [Professor Jian Zhang](https://www.kent.ac.uk/mathematics-statistics-actuarial-science/people/413/zhang-jian). I earned my Master degree in Statistics at [Yunnan University](http://www.ms.ynu.edu.cn/ENGLISH.htm). I was a student of [Professor Niansheng Tang](http://www.ms.ynu.edu.cn/info/1092/1634.htm).

My main research interest lies in

- Change-point Detection and Machine Learning
- Nonparametric Inference in High-dimensional Statistics
- Neuroscience (MEG/EEG Source Imaging)
- Dynamic Causal Modelling (DCM) in fMRI and MEG
- Functional Data Analysis
